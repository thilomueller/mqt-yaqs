"""Tests for MPO-based equivalence checking implementation.

This module provides unit tests for the equivalence checker implemented in
mqt.yaqs.circuits.equivalence_checker. It verifies the correctness of the
MPO-based equivalence algorithm by comparing quantum circuits. Tests include
checks for:
  - Identity circuits (empty circuits) which should be equivalent.
  - Two-qubit circuits that implement the same operation (e.g., Bell state preparation).
  - Two-qubit circuits that differ by an extra gate, which should be non-equivalent.
  - Long-range circuits, ensuring that circuits with identical long-range interactions
    are equivalent, while those with additional gates are not.
