"""Stochastic Process of the Tensor Jump Method.

This module implements stochastic processes for quantum systems represented as Matrix Product States (MPS).
It provides functions to compute the stochastic factor, generate a probability distribution for quantum jumps
based on a noise model, and perform a stochastic (quantum jump) process on the state. These tools are used
to simulate noise-induced evolution in quantum many-body systems.

    The function sweeps from left to right over the sites of the MPS. For each site,

      - For each 1-site jump operator acting on the current site, it constructs a candidate
        post-jump state, computes the corresponding quantum jump probability (proportional to the
        time step, jump strength, and post-jump norm at that site), and records the operator and
        site.
      - For each 2-site jump operator acting on the current site and its right neighbor,
        it merges the two tensors, applies the operator, splits the result, computes the probability,
        and records the operator and the site pair.
