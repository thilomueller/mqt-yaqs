"""Dissipative sweep of the Tensor Jump Method.

This module implements a function to apply dissipation to a quantum state represented as an MPS.
The dissipative operator is computed from a noise model by exponentiating a weighted sum of jump operators,
and is then applied to each tensor in the MPS via tensor contraction. If no noise is present or if all
noise strengths are zero, the MPS is simply shifted to its canonical form.

    """Apply dissipation to the system state using a given noise model and time step.

    This function modifies the state tensors of an MPS by applying a dissipative operator
    that is calculated from the noise model's jump operators and strengths. The operator is
    computed by exponentiating a matrix derived from these jump operators, and then applied to
    each tensor in the state using an Einstein summation contraction.

    Args:
        state: The Matrix Product State representing the current state of the system.
        noise_model): The noise model containing jump operators and their
            corresponding strengths. If None or if all strengths are zero, no dissipation is applied.
        dt: The time step for the evolution, used in the exponentiation of the dissipative operator.
        sim_params: Simulation parameters that include settings.

    Notes:
        - If no noise is present (i.e. `noise_model` is None or all noise strengths are zero),
          the function shifts the orthogonality center of the MPS tensors and returns early.
        - The dissipation operator A is calculated as a sum over each jump operator, where each
          term is given by (noise strength) * (conjugate transpose of the jump operator) multiplied
          by the jump operator.
        - The dissipative operator is computed using the matrix exponential `expm(-0.5 * dt * A)`.
        - The operator is then applied to each tensor in the MPS via a contraction using `opt_einsum`.
